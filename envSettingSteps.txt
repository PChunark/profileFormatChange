How to install a conda by using the Command Prompt (CMD) in window
The miniconda is a Linux. It is used to create a snakemake file and other workflows.
Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, 
the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others).

1. Download miniconda and install
https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/

2. Set path in Environmental variables
Step 1: Right click "This PC" --> Properties --> Advanced system setting --> Environmental Variables --> Select&Edit "PATH" for both the windows 
--> Set path by going to your miniconda storage. In this case "C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\Scripts"

3. Download the Cygwin software. This software brings Linux engine to Window
Step 1: https://www.cygwin.com/install.html
Step 2: Restart your computer

4. Check and Update the conda version in the Command Prompt (CMD)
Step 1: Start the CMD with "Run as Administrator"
Step 2: conda --version
Step 3: conda update -n base -c defaults conda
Step 4: Typing "y" in the cmd which means "yes, accept for update the version"
Step 5: Recheck your conda version. The version should be different from Step 2.
-n base: a name of the base environment that we need to update
-c defaults: get conda from the default channel.

5. Download & Install Memba
Memba is a rewritten version of conda. It is faster than conda. It is great for working and building environment. 
Step 1: conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
Step 2: Check the version by mamba --version 
-c conda-forge: looking in the conda-forge channel

6. Create an environment for the "profileFormatChange" project. It can be used 2 commands.
1. mamba create -n frmChg -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c R r-base=4.2 r-tidyverse=2.0.0
2. mamba env create -f environment.yml. This command needs a "environment.yml" file.
